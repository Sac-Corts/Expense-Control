# ðŸ’° Expense Control
This application allows users to manage their personal budget in an intuitive and dynamic way. It offers a modern interface where users can set a budget, record and organize their expenses, and get a clear view of their financial situation in real time.

## :star2: Features
- **Set an initial budget** to keep track of your expenses.
- **Add new expenses** with details like name, category, amount, and date.
- **Edit or delete expenses** easily with swipe animations.
- **Filter expenses by category**, enabling focused views.
- **Dynamic chart** to visually represent spending.
- **Reset button** to restart the app from scratch.
- **LocalStorage persistence**, so expense data remains even after refreshing the page.
- **Automatic calculation** of available budget and spent budget.

## :gear: Technologies Used
- **React with TypeScript:** For a robust, typed structure in managing components and states.
- **Vite:** For fast and efficient development.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For modern and flexible UI styling.

## :wrench: Performance Optimization
To enhance performance, I implemented:

- **useContext:** To share global states, like budget and expenses, across components.
- **useReducer:** For predictable and organized state management.
- **useMemo:** For performance optimization by memoizing computed values.
- **useState:** To manage local component states.
- **Custom Hooks:** Implemented reusable logic to simplify and organize the code.
